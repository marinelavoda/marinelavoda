I am a Data Science and Economics double major at Minerva University. I'm passionate about turning ideas into impactful solutions and aspire to become a Project Manager who bridges the gap between data, people, and product.



- 🌱 I'm an incoming [Stanford Ecopreneurship](https://ecopreneurship.stanford.edu/) Intern, where I'll work on promoting the program's mission of accelerating a multi-trillion dollar transition to address current global climate and sustainability challenges and create a future where humans and nature thrive in concert and in perpetuity. A few of my tasks will include promoting workshops with Stanford faculty and working on research related to accessible ecopreneurship education :)
- 🤝 I'm also working as a [Civic Projects](https://irb.minerva.edu/civic-projects/) Intern at Minerva University, where I help connect Minerva with companies that the incoming class of 2029 can work with during their freshman year.
- 💻 I worked as a UI/UX designer at [Uniport](https://www.uniport.asia/en), a Korean startup, as a Software Engineering research assistant at [National Taiwan University](https://ntubeats.ntu.edu.tw/enews/94/04.pdf), and a Mobile App Developer at [Andgreen](https://web.andgreen.org/), a Taiwanese startup focused on sustainability.
- 👥 Working with people is a big part of who I am, and it's why I like helping the communities I'm part of. It's what led me to become a [Second Day Impact Fellow](https://www.secondday.org/apply), after being recognized for high potential in social impact leadership, and a [National League of Cities](https://www.nlc.org/) Strategic Partnerships Intern.
- 🎨 I paint a lot too! Check out my art portfolio here, and my online Custom Clothes Shop [here](https://www.instagram.com/customclothesbymarinela/reels/)!
